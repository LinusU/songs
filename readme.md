# Sånghäfte till statistikdagssittningen 2022 (song book for the international statistics day-dinner 2022)
This is a song book to be used on the Statistical Student Council's dinner celebrating the international statistics day at Stockholm's University in october 2022.

Feel free to clone this repository if you want to create a song book for your event!

## How it works
- `index.html` contains all songs
- `table.js` creates a dynamic table of contents from the songs defined in the html file (`class = "song"`)
- `style.css` defines the style of the page.
